<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT 
## Meet & Eat -->
![MeetEatLogo!](https://i.ibb.co/55WnHQx/header-Image.png)

**“Most people love to eat out at a restaurant but dont have anyone to go with. As a result they
choose either to eat alone, or not go out at all, and they miss out on experiences that could have
been spent building relationships with others.”**

My app Meet & Eat intends to solve this problem 
by helping the user create platonic with those who are looking to have new experiences and meet new people. 
The idea came because I am myself often times really want to go out to eat but my friends are either busy or dont want to go. 
Meet and Eat seeks to resolve this conflict giving people new opportunities connect with others in a safe and open environement, while enjoying 
their favorite foods. 

To begin, the user creates a new account with an email and user chosen password. They will then create their profile page that will be viewed by other users 
and used to help others determine if they would like to create a "Meetup" with you. Once your profile creattion is complete you are free to create a new Meetup and request 
someone to go out to eat with you, or look through your feed of Meetups already created by other users. Once you decide to meet with another user a notification is
delivered and a choice whether to accept is offered. 

## Ideation & Testing

In early stages of my development and testing I was able to validate my problem statement
and give myself the confidence that it was actually relevant and important. From these
observations I was able to understand how people would potentially use my app, why it would be
useful for them, and what they would want in terms of functionality. These observations in turn
influenced my design process and overall execution of the application.

Primary users of Meet & Eat tend to fall under these two classifications: 
* Those looking to develop new relationships with friends
* Those looking to eat out and have fun

### Personas
Below are my primary and secondary personas(respectively) I created for this application.

Both of these users are people who are comfortable with talking with others or meeting new
people and are looking for something more in their life in terms of the experiences they are
having. Ideally they are people comfortable online as well and open to mobile communication.
My personas and potential users are motivated by growing, social interaction, and incentive.

## Development 

Meet & Eat was developed using React Native. The project includes a sign in/sign up page, a profile page and logical states to create your profile page, a feed 
of user submittted "Meetups", and a home page to create your own Meetup.
